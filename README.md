# Fragility_Prediction_with_AI
This project is focused on applying artificial intelligence (AI) models to detect and assess the level of frailty in older adults. The goal is to provide accurate predictions of both the presence and severity of frailty, a key factor in elderly health management.

The project includes:

Preprocessing of clinical and sensor data;

Training machine learning models, including XGBoost for binary and multi-class classification;

Visualizations for model evaluation and interpretability.

This repository serves as a reference for AI-based frailty prediction and as a foundation for further research in geriatric health analytics.
