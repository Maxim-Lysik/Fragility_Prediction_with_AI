# Fragility_Prediction_with_AI

Fragility_Prediction_with_AI is a project focused on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) models to detect and assess the level of frailty in older adults. The goal is to provide accurate predictions of both the presence and severity of frailty, which is a critical factor in elderly health management.

The project leverages real-world data from the publicly available GSTRIDE database: https://zenodo.org/records/6883292
. It includes preprocessing of clinical and sensor data, training of machine learning models (including XGBoost for binary and multi-class classification), and visualizations for model evaluation and interpretation.

This repository can be used as a reference for AI-based frailty prediction, and as a foundation for further research in geriatric health analytics.
