# Fragility_Prediction_with_AI

This project focuses on applying artificial intelligence (AI) models to detect and assess the level of frailty in older adults. The goal is to provide accurate predictions of both the presence and severity of frailty, a key factor in elderly health management.

## Project Highlights

- Preprocessing of clinical and sensor data
- Training machine learning models, including XGBoost for binary and multi-class classification
- Visualizations for model evaluation and interpretability

This repository serves as a reference for AI-based frailty prediction and as a foundation for further research in geriatric health analytics.
